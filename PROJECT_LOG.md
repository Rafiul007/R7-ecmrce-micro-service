- starting with IAM service.
- last time work with customer registration and employee registration.
- API working for both of them.
- Initial Idea was to build an universal auth-service that can be use in any project. Then dropped the idea to to merge auth
  customer service together.
- Now I have planned to make a user registration and authetication api. A register user can create profile for customer/eployee.
- For employee, only admin can create.

- customer registration perfect.
- But needs refactoring in customer controller, and routes.
